That's Galaxy COOPER manifest for B2G:

For compiling, that's different from official MOZILLA's method:
- mkdir ~/bin
- PATH=~/bin:$PATH
- curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo
- chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
- mkdir B2G
- cd B2G
- repo init -u https://github.com/MoltenMotherBoard/b2g-manifest
- repo sync
- . build/envsetup.sh
- lunch /* Choose your build */
- make -j1

In essence, is the same method used for any Android distribution.
